# Weather-Website

A single-page website for viewing the weather connected to a school project.

Made with the `bun-react-tailwind-shadcn-template` template provided by `bun init`.
This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.11. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

The entrypoint for this project is `/src/index.ts`. Some files are auto-generated and therefore do not have detailed comments.

## How to get started

Firstly, make sure you have the Bun runtime installed as well as `arduino-cli`.
Afterwards, install the dependencies required in this project:

```bash
bun install
```

If you do not have the Arduino set up according to the schematic diagram, run the command below to start the website:

```bash
bun dev
```

If you have the Arduino connected with the adjusted ports and identifiers in the code, run the command below to start the website:

```bash
bun start
```
